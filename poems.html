      <p>My student asked</p>
      <p>If I could make a website for her poem</p>
      <p>I said yes</p>
      <p>And then I made a blank link</p>
      <p>Trying to get her to write a poem</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>She never wrote one</p>
      <p>She also demanded the dog picture</p>
      <p>The cat picture was all me though</p>
